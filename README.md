# Rutgers_Final_Project - Deliverable 2

## Project Overview
Our team is analyzing what impacts a dog's likelihood to be adopted from a shelter in order to create a website that will be informative and helpful for users. We are utilizing a dataset that was found on kaggle.com and provides insight into the census of a dog shelter in December 2019. Our overall goal is that when prospective adopters stumble upon our website, they will clearly be able to see the likelihood a dog is available based on certain criterias they are looking for in their forever friend.

3. Machine Learning Model

    Our machine learning model is a work in progress that has seen a lot of improvements since our first submission in Deliverable 1. 

   Check out our Machine Leaning Model branch found [here](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/tree/Natalie) 

4. Database

    Our database query language can be found [here](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/blob/Annie/shelterdogdbcreation.sql)

    Our Python file connecting us to SQL can be found [by clicking here](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/blob/Annie/ShelterDogs_SQL_Connection.ipynb)                     
    
    Through our work we have:
    
      - Stored static data for use during the project
      
      - Interfaced with the project (ie database connects to the model)

      - Created 6 different tables 
      
      ![tables](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/blob/Database/Resources/table%20count.png)
      
      
      
      - Created a full join into a new table

      - Utilized a connection string
      
      ![string](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/blob/Database/Resources/SQLAlchemy.png)
      
      
      
      - Created an ERD with relationships
      
      ![ERD](https://github.com/nataliecagno/Rutgers_Final_Project/blob/Database/Resources/Capstone%20ERD.png)
      
      Please note that some transforming of data was conducted prior to importing into SQL in alignment with project goals.
